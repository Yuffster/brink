---

Brink.js is a modular platform for full-stack, unified and reactive Web development using JavaScript.

This particular repository is the alpha sandbox.  When finished, this repository will be nothing
but a package.json file, a command line script, and some assorted documentation on the architecture
of the rest of the system.

The component modules are designed to be usable as soon as they're finished, rather than waiting for
the entire library to be constructed.
